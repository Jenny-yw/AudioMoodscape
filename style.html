    <h1>How are you feeling?</h1>
    <h2>ðŸ—£ speak out loud about your emotions and thoughts</h2>
    <h3>What is this about?</h3>
    <p>It feels good to talk about your day and how you feel. That's why we talk to our friends or close ones about it. Sometimes we don't say what we mean when we're emotional, especially for upsetting events. Over time, Negative words can have negative impacts on our mindset without us realizing it. This moodscape generator can let you see how negative or positive your feelings and thoughts are while giving you a relaxing visual output. I hope the moodscape can help you to be more aware of your thoughts and to cultivate the power of positive thinking.</p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>You start speak out loud about how you're feeling. You shouldn't whisper, so I suggest you to test it at a place you're comfortable. It takes some time for your moodscape to start generating, so please be patient. Once you are done, just stop speaking and you can save your moodscape by clicking the save button at the bottom of the graphic. Hope you enjoy it! ðŸŒˆ ðŸ˜Š </p>
